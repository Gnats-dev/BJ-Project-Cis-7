At the start the user is given the option to play the game or view the rules.  If the rules are chosen, they will be shown the rules and it will loop back to the start of the program.  Once the user starts the game, they are required to make an account with simple information such as a username and email.  If the user has already made an account, they can log in with the information that they had used before.  If there is more than one user than both must make accounts or log in (only up to 2 players).  This account keeps track of the total money the user has.  The gameplay itself is simple blackjack with limits.  At the end of each match, the user is given the option to play again or quit the game.

The game is navigated using user input. The user will be prompted to hit certin keys for their desired result.

I approached this project with the desire to implement as many concepts as possible. Since I reacently went to a casino myself, I was familer with the rules of blackjack.  I knew I had an old unfinished blackjack program, so I chose to do this as my project and finish what I started.
